          <p>I worked mostly on a React based frontend stack, had a role developing Android apps, and  
            contributed to the Rails backend. 
            This is where I learned and really appreciated functional programming for React and how elegant 
            it can be. I used great libraries such as Ramda, Recompose and Emototion.

            This is really where I felt my interest for the visual design and development found its intersection. 
            I worked with a team of designers and built my foundations for frontend development, allowing me 
            to make beautiful, efficient and functional applications.

            I had a very interesting role as a consultant and developer. This was a good opportunity for me to learn multiple

            products.
